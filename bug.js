I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I had a simple div with the class `bg-red-500`, but the background color remained unchanged. My configuration and build process seemed correct, and the classes were properly included in the CSS output. However, inspecting the element with the browser's developer tools revealed that the `bg-red-500` class was missing from the `class` attribute. I found the problem when I examined my Javascript and found that the class names were being dynamically updated using `className` instead of `classList`. Replacing `className` with `classList.add` or `classList.toggle` resolved the problem.
